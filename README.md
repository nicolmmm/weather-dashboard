# weather-dashboard

For this project I have used vanilla Javascript to build a weather forecast application.

The application relies on 2 server side API calls. One to get the latitude and longitude of the user's search and another to get the weather details.

This project has taught me a lot about dynamically adding elements to the page and has also allowed me to explore event delegation in a non-jQuery context.
